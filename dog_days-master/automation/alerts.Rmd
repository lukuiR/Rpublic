We look at download trends in the following packages.

```{r}
library(drake)
```


Using the cranlogs package, we calculate the mean number of downloads for each package from the RStudio CRAN mirror. We show these averages for the last month,

```{r}
readd(table_layla)
```

and from November 1 to December 1 in 2016.


```{r}
readd(table_lloyd)
```


We visualize the daily downloads from the last month,

readd(plot_recent)

and from November 1 to December 1 in 2016.

readd(plot_older)
